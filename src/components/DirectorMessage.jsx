        {" "}
        We strive to strengthen the skills of dentists and allied professionals
        through training that translates into practical strategies for serving a
        population with special needs. Our direction is clear, reflected in our
        logo and name: to promote well-being from the root on a solid foundation
        of training, a trunk supported by the preparation and expertise of our
        team, and branches with leaves that positively affect both the
        professional community and the patients we serve.

        Our long-term goal is for SANUS PR to serve as a reference, a
        sustainable program that paves the way for inclusive and effective oral
        care. Our vision stems from the HRSA Oral Health Workforce Grant
        T1249075 proposal, and we aspire to be an inspiring model for programs
        and professionals interested in oral well-being. We invite you to
        explore our website for practical and beneficial educational
        information. We are excited about the impact we can achieve together.
